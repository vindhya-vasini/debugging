## Stretch Blocks

In this challenge, you will be learning about Debugging

## Release 0:

Try the problem given in `CoreBlocks/Debugging/Release0` using special keyword called `finally`

## Release 1:

### Fix the broken code and explain what was wrong:

```js
function displayEvenNumbers(){
    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
    var evenNumbers = [];
    for(var i=0; i<numbers.length-1; i++;){
        if(numbers % 2 = 0); {
            evenNumbers.push(i);
        }
        return evenNumbers;
    }
}
displayEvenNumbers(); // should return [2,4,6,8] 

// HINT - eight things need to be changed here for this to work!
```
